# Abstract Classes in PHP

An abstract class is one that cannot be instantiated, only inherited. It is declared
with the keyword `abstract`:

```php
<?php

abstract class MyAbstractClass
{
    public function myImplementedMethod()
    {
        echo 'Hello World!';
    }
}
```

Abstract classes can also contain abstract methods. Abstract methods are methods without body (implementation).

```php
<?php

abstract class MyAbstractClass
{
    public function myImplementedMethod()
    {
        echo 'Hello World!';
    }
    
    // Body can be simply omitted.
    abstract function myAbstractMethod();
}
``` 

When inheriting from an abstract class, all methods marked abstract in the
parent's class declaration must be defined by the child; additionally, these
methods must be defined with the same (or a less restricted) visibility.

```php
<?php

abstract class MyAbstractClass
{
    public function myImplementedMethod()
    {
        echo 'Hello World!';
    }
    
    // Although this method was declared protected,
    abstract protected function myAbstractMethod();
}

class MyConcreteClass extends MyAbstractClass
{
    // but it can be public in child class.
    public function myAbstractMethod()
    {
        echo "I'm now implemented!";
    }
}
```

It is not legal to have abstract function definitions inside a non-abstract class.
Any class that contains at least one abstract method, must be declared `abstract`.
In PHP, abstract classes cannot be declared `final`.
